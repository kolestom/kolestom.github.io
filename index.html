    <div class="texts">
      In my spare time at Wald's Parts junk shop I designed and built a
      Class III open cockpit Podracer capable of 588 mph top speed.
      Went on to win the Boonta Eve Classic race in 32 BBY - first ever
      win by a human. Generated documented company revenue of over 59
      wupiupi during the course of my enslavement.

    <div class="texts">
      During my tenure as a Supreme Imperial Fleet Commander I was in
      charge of large capital construction projects for the Deep Space
      Fleet. Performed acceptance testing of the DS1 SuperLaser in
      0 BBY by annihilating Alderaan - a terrestrial class planet in
      the Core Worlds region. Successfully tripled the deep space fire
      power of the imperial fleet in accordance with the Tarkin Doctrine
      before losing both projects to run-away photon torpedoes.
